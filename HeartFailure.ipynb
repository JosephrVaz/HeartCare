        " Cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of patient risk, coupled with personalized treatment recommendations, is crucial for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens. However, traditional risk assessment methods often lack precision, and generalized treatment guidelines may not be optimal for individual patients with unique characteristics.\n",
